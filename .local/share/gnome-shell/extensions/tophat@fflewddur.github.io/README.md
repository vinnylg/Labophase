# TopHat

TopHat aims to be an elegant system resource monitor for the GNOME shell. It
displays CPU, memory, disk, and network activity in the GNOME top bar.

## Release notes

See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for the list of fixes and new functionality
included in each release.

## Installation

Install TopHat from the [GNOME Shell extensions
page](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5219/tophat/).

Most Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu and Pop!_OS) will also need
'gir1.2-gtop-2.0' to be installed. Usually this means running the command
`sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0` followed by a system restart.

### Requirements

- GNOME 3.32 or newer
- The gtop system monitoring library (e.g., 'libgtop' on Debian-based systems,
  likely already installed as part of GNOME)
- GIRepository (gir) bindings for the gtop system monitoring library (e.g.,
  'gir1.2-gtop-2.0' on Debian-based systems)

### Compatibility

The latest release of TopHat has been tested on the following systems:

- Arch Linux
- CentOS Stream 8
- CentOS Stream 9
- Debian 11.7 (first install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 package)
- Debian 12 (first install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 package)
- Fedora 38
- openSUSE Leap 15.4 (first install typelib-1_0-GTop-2_0 package)
- Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS (first install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 package)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (first install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 package)
- Ubuntu 23.04 (first install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 package)

Even if your system is not in this list, as long as it meets the
requirements mentioned above, you should be able to run TopHat. If not, please
file a bug report on [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/issues).

### Manual installation

If you prefer not to use https://extensions.gnome.org to install and update
GNOME Shell extensions, you can manually install TopHat by following these
steps. You may need to install the `unzip` and `gnome-extensions-app`
utilities first.

1) Download the latest TopHat release from
   https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/releases.
2) Ensure your local extension directory exists by running the command `mkdir
   -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io`.
3) Extract the TopHat ZIP file into your local extension directory with the
   command `unzip [path-to-tophat.zip] -d
   ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io`
4) Log out of your computer and log back in (or restart your system).
5) Enable TopHat in the `gnome-extensions-app`.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve TopHat are welcome! To avoid duplicate work, check
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/fflewddur/tophat/issues) first. If an
issue doesn't already exist for your idea, please create one.

To keep the code format consistent, please use `eslint` before submitting a
PR. You can install eslint by running the command `npm install eslint` from
the TopHat repo directory. To run the linter, use the command
`./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js . --ext .js`; alternatively, the ESLint
plugin for VS Code will automatically run the linter for you.

### Useful development commands

To view GNOME Shell logs output: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`

To view logs for extension preferences: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gjs`

To simulate heavy system load, use the `stress-ng` tool, e.g. `stress-ng
--timeout 10s --cpu 8` or `stress-ng --vm-bytes 80% --vm-populate -t 30 -vm
4`.

To test the development version:

    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    ln -s [path to tophat repository]/tophat@fflewddur.github.io ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tophat@fflewddur.github.io
